My Genomic Medicine dissertation using Single Cell Transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) to study B Cell Differentiation and compare it to bulk data, specifically in Immune Mediated Inflammatory Diseases such as Sj√∂gren's syndrome. A work in progress!


- The main tutorial on scRNA-seq clustering by Satija Lab that was used can be found here: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html#standard-pre-processing-workflow

- The Jupyter Notebook used for the bulk data analysis developed by Barnes Lab can be found in this GitHub repository: https://github.com/C4TB/CTR_XAI

- The datasets (GSE182221) from Espinoza et al. (2023) are available on the NCBI GEO website to download: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE182221
